<strong>DESCRIPTION OF REFACTOR UPDATES</strong>

Refactored the html and css code for the Horiseon website to make it accessible. The structure of the semantic HTML elements was updated to follow a logical structure indepedent
of styling and positioning with comments added. The images were giving alt attributes and the heading attributes were organized into sequential order. The title element was 
updated with a concise and descriptive title. The css was organized to follow the flow of the HTML elements, consolidated, and comments were added. The refactoring process was 
based upon Horiseon's Story and Acceptance Criteria.
